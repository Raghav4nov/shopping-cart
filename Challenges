1. Setting Up the Project
Vite + React Configuration: Initially struggled with setting up Vite 

Tailwind CSS Integration: Had issues with PostCSS configuration until I followed the docs carefully.

2. State Management
Context API Confusion: Understanding useReducer with CartContext was tricky—especially updating state immutably.

Prop Drilling: Initially passed props too deeply before realizing Context was the solution.

3. Cart Modal Issues
Portal Not Rendering: Forgot to add the <div id="modal"></div> in index.html.

Dialog Not Opening: Debugged for hours before realizing cartIsVisible state wasn’t updating properly.

4. Data Fetching
Firebase Frustration: API calls failed due to CORS/network errors, so switched to local JSON.

JSON Import Paths: Initially used wrong relative paths

5. Deployment Problems
Blank GitHub Pages: Forgot the base: '/repo-name/' in vite.config.js.

Broken Styles: Tailwind classes didn’t load in production until I rebuilt with npm run build.

6. Responsive Design
Mobile Layout: Cart modal overflowed on small screens—fixed with max-width and viewport units.

Key Lessons Learned
✔ Always check the DOM: Use React DevTools to debug state/portal issues.
✔ Start simple: Local JSON > Firebase for beginners.
✔ Read errors carefully: Most solutions were in the console logs!
